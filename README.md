Hi! I'm an octopus farmer. I keep the critters happy by making sure they don't get all tangled up.

Most of my work is in web development, but I'm not specifically a web developer. I've also written device drivers (the kind that require an oscilloscope to debug), a heuristic calibration system for linear delta robots (3D printers), and other fun stuff. I started programming on an Apple ]\[E in the '80s.

Some things I like:
- Knowing who Trygve Reenskaug is
- Solving problems that "can't be solved" (ask me about NeoPixels)
- Docks that don't go into conniptions or forget how my monitors are arranged every day
- YouTubes of Robert C. Martin and anyone else wiser than me
- Creating diagrams and huge, nested bullet lists before I begin stubbing out classes and tests
- Clean code, SOLID design principles, test-driven development
- Staring at complex code I wrote before TDD and asking myself, "how did I endure writing this"
- Code reviews with developers who read my code and tell me what they don't like
- Piping the XDebug profiler into `kcachegrind`
- ARM bus architecture, DMA channels, PWM controllers, machine learning, 3D printers
- Assembly languages, the growing amount of inline assembly in PHP
- `CONNECT 14400/ARQ/V34/LAPM/V42BIS`
- Adafruit, The 8-Bit Guy, Farbrausch, Future Crew, and Elitegroup
- Dr. SBAITSO, Gravis Ultrasound, Port 220, IRQ 5, DMA 1
